# Slack Tips

---

Slack is a firehose.

Two things will make it much more manageable.

---

## 1. Slack Tips & Tricks

---

Not missing replies with Threads view

---

"Unfollow thread"

---

Pins

---

## 2. Slack Etiquette

---

Let's do our best to keep the channel light

---

Replies should always be in-thread

---

**Exception:** If it's important that the whole class see your reply.

But even in that case: you should reply in-thread, and then share your reply (demo this!)

---

**Asking a question with a big code snippet**

Add the code as a comment in the thread (demo)

# Asking Questions

---

Slack is asynchronous communication.

---

To make life easier for everybody, include _a lot_ of context in your question.

---

Should include:

- Which workshop and exercise you're working on
- relevant code snippet
- What you expect to happen, and what is actually happening
- _Why_ you expect it to do something different
- _What you've tried_ that didn't work
- Screenshots, if applicable
- _Link to code_ on Github (be sure to push!)

Hi - I'm working on Exercise 3 in Workshop 10, I'm a bit confused.

I have a container with 3 items:

```
<div>
  <nav>Nav</nav>
  <section>Stuff</section>
  <footer>Footer</footer>
</div>
```

The relevant CSS is:

```
section {
  flex: 1;
}
```

Since `section` has `flex: 1;`, I would expect it to fill the total available height, but it isn't growing at all. I thought that flex: 1 made the child take up the whole window height.

I tried adding `flex: 1` to the other children but it had no effect.

Following these steps may be arduous, but it can save a lot of back-and-forth, and lead to a quicker resolution to your problem.

# Workshop forks

(unrelated)

---

Some students have noticed that all workshops exist in two places on Github:

- `journey-education/m4-1-magic-whatever`
- `cb-nw-3/m4-1-magic-whatever`

---

`journey-education` is the "original" version.

`cb-nw-3` is one that I've tweaked to work for our cohort.

---

**Always** fork from the cb-nw-3 one.

Otherwise, things will be very confusing. I change/reorder exercises!

---

You can always find the right workshop repositories in the Course Log.

The Course Log is linked to from Slack.

---

(don't worry about the first 3 workshops though. We'll check both places).
